Some codes concerning CRUD features in PHP + jQuery + Bootstrap + MySql in order to support my lectures at IFCE.

I need to teach them the fundamentals and differences of using mysqli_connect function and PDO while developing CRUD features.

Source codes used and adapted from:  
(PDO) https://www.webslesson.info/2017/01/php-pdo-crud-with-ajax-jquery-and-bootstrap.html
(mysqli_connect) https://www.webslesson.info/2016/12/php-ajax-crud-using-oops-select-or-fetch-mysql-data.html


Then, we created an application example from a free template (https://www.templatemonster.com/free-templates/responsive-business-website-template-55227.html) and added some php codes in it using PDO approach.
